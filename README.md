# Common list sorting algorithms 

Easy to read Python implementations with helpful print statements for a faciliatated understanding of insertion sort, mergesort and quicksort. 

Test file uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) and [hypothesis](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) to introduce the reader to use these good packages if he doesn't have them already. Test file is not crucial to usage or understanding of algorithm.

## Run

You will need [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) to run `test.py` as well as the [hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library. 

```
brew install pytest
pip install hypothesis
```

If everything works correctly you should be able ot type 

```
pytest test.py
```
without any errors.
